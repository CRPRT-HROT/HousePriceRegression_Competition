# HousePriceRegression_Competition
My attempt at this kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview
Used python.

My best attempt places me at position 360 with a score of 0.12147. The code in this repository currently is not that attempt.

Initial code structure was based on the notebook found at: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/feature-engineering-for-house-prices
